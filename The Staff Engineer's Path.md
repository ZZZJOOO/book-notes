## 4. Finite Time
When you level up, you see more problems at hand. And you can't do them all.
### 4.1 Doing All the Things
You decide what you work on everyday with limited time: what's important for the company, team and you.

### 4.2 Time
Every task you choose to work on has an opportunity cost. Decision comes with a cost.
#### 4.2.1 Finite Time
- Put focused work time in the calendar and plan for task you would like to take on for the day and week. Thus you keep track of what you plan to do throughout the day and if you have time for a side request.
- If you look at longer terms, you might need to block some fraction of time
#### 4.2.2 How Busy Do You Like to Be
- Some work could be unpredictable.
- Drop something for emergency.
- Observe your weekly work load and comfort/stress limit.
#### 4.2.3 ProjectQueue.pop()
- Locator map tells you what's important. Treasure map tells you what you could deliver.
- Evaluate the importance of each project, task, issue.
- List out a list of work you should take. Sort them out according to priority.
### 4.3 Resource Constraints
### 4.4 Choosing Projects

## You're a Role Model Now(Sorry)
### What Does It Mean to Do a Good Job?

If you are a role model, then
- you should point out the problems
- you should influence through good, thoughtful decisions and effective collaboration
- others would see how you behave and take that as a standard, and emulate what you do in order to level up
- you should take leadership as some skill to learn similiar to a new programming language/tech stack. You could start small, eg. by help onboard new team members

### Be Competent
Staff engineer = technical + leader

#### Know Things
Devote enough time to building experience
- time * (learning + practice) => tech skill
- You are not expected to know every topic. It's okay if you know the least on some new area/domain. Start learning from there.

Learning quickly
1. Walk through an example, some basic concepts
2. Know the trade-off, constraints, assumptions
3. What technologies are on the market, how to use them
4. What is famous in the domain(people, literature, company), what they advocate for
5. take on some projects

Stay engaged with the new changes happenning in your industry.

Stay anchored in technology as well as know how your company operate.

Learn in public: deliberately show other engineers what you are learning and how you learn.


#### Be Self-Aware
Self-awareness: 
- what you can do, what you can't do
- how much time it will take
- What you know, what you don't know. Admit what you know and step up to help what needed. Admit what you don't know and ask others to explain like I am 5yr.

You have your own perspective and context and understanding of the world. But that might not seem obvious to others. You need to escape the echo chamber and bridge the gap for others in order to understand what you see.

Try to explain things in plain text and as if you are explaining to a 5 years old child.


#### Have High Standards
Your standards will influence how other people work.

You should know the high standard and aim for that whenever you are working on something, even if they might not be the parts you enjoy.
- Write clear doc
- Know when and why your software breaks
- Put aside your ego and ask someone else to make your work better: code review, design review, peer evaluations and feedbacks
- Ack you will make mistakes. Don't defend them. Try to learn from them and set out to root-cause it and make a fix. 

Show your work and earn trust from others.


### Be Responsible

#### Take Ownership
You own the whole problem: you are accountable for navigating the problem, driving end to end development, unblocking any issues occuring.
- You have good judgement.
- You share the context of what you are doing with others, thus you give other opportunities to intervene if you are doing something dangerous.
- You make decisions when needed even if you could be wrong. Don't just stay on the fense: weigh the options, choose decisively and explain your reasoning
- Ask dump questions. You should make the implicit explicit.
- Glue work: unblocking, onboarding, reminders, mentoring, scheduling. This is needed for project success.

#### Take Charge
When you see a gap, you step in to fill that gap.
- You should be able to take control of SEV 2 chaos. You should have the emergency plan before disaster occurs. Take notes and make sure everyone envolved has the context.
- Ask for more information when everyone is confused, even if you think you are the only one feeling confused.
- Don't feign surprise. Encourage others to ask basic questions.
- Drive the meeting. Step up and collect items to discuss in the meeting. Remember your expectation for the meeting and drag it back to the topic when meeting goes too far away.
- Make the meeting notes. Write down important facts you learn, key decisions made.
- Stay calm. Think about the impact of your actions. Don't let you worries spill out on many people.
- Don't blame. Create an environment where everyone feels safe to talk about the event when something breaks.
- Be consistent. Work in a way that is substainable for you.

### Remember the Goal
Think about the broader context: the business goal your org is trying to achieve, what your customers care about, your team's success.

#### Remember There's a Business
THe software is the means to those ends, not an end in itself.
- When you priority is timeline, deliver faster solution is better. If there's a hard deadline, imperfect solution is better than a late one.
- Your priorities will change.
- There's a budget for your project. Be aware how your company make money and the economic environment. Decide what to suggest for your org based on that.
- Staffing a project has an opportunity cost. Choose work that your business need the most.

#### Remember There's a User
- Write down the requirements. Be clear.

#### Remember There's a Team
- Be a force multiplier. Empower your collegues to do better work.
- Don't be a single point of failure.

### Look Ahead
Software engineering is programing integrated over time. Think beyond the current moment and don't optimize for now at the cost of future velocity or engineering ability.

#### Anticipate What You'll Wish You'd Done
What will future you wish present you had done?
- Telegraph what's coming. Anounce the intension to deprecate old systems early so that other team could make plans in advance.
- Make your codebase, production enviroment, documentation ready to use and move around for whoever comes along next.
- Make your environment a better place. Find tools/approaches to increase your velocity and reliability. Automate repetative process.
- Write down formative systems and practices. Create instituition memory.

#### Expect Failures
Plan for what you'll do when something goes wrong. Test the error paths and design your system to be fault tolerant.

#### Optimize for Maintenance, Not Creation
Design your software with good maintenance. You spend more time maintaining your code than creating it. Even if your code remain unchanged, the ecosystem will change over time.

- Make your system easy to understand. Write readable code. Write good documents.
- Keep it super simple. Devote time to simplify the current solution or come up with alternatives.
- Build your system in a way that's easy to decommission.(modular)

#### Create Future Leaders
Be the engineer that everyone wants to work with.

### Summary
Competence <- experience + knowledge =  time * doing + time * (learning expertise)

Be self-aware: Unknown Unknown

Take charge on hard problems and acknowledge the discomfort.

Write things down clearly.

Design your software that's easy to maintain, easy to decommission and fault-tolerant.

The metric for success is whether other people want to work with you.

## What's Next
You now know 
- What your job is
- your scope and primary focus
- how to develop strategy and vision
- how to prioritize work and lead projects
- how to navigate obstacles
- how to model good engineering
- how to level up your team

Think about how to level up your life?

### Your Career
Where are you going in your career and life journey? Look around and think of the options as paths in the trail map.

#### What's Important to You
- Some life priorities could: being financially secure, supporting family, having flexible schedules, learning opportunities, challenging yourself
- Find out what matters to you and work backwards from that

#### Where Are You Going?
- Look at the big picture and your priorities
- Figure out a plan, set up some milestones
- Make SMART goals(specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, timebounded)
- Checkout others' journey. Don't limit yourself to your current perspective. 
- Consider path that are risker. Don't limit yourself to stay in the comfort zone.

#### What Do You Need to Invest in?
What skill do those future role models have? How do they spend time? How do they build up the network?
- Skills are learnable. You need to make efforts to get experience points for skills you would like to level up.
- Work backwards from your goal and find out the necessary skills. You can't be expert at everything.(technical domain, glue work, leadership)
- Learn how to build a network for your career. 
- Making a name for yourself and make your career profolio visible.
- Decide which project to work on. Your decision on role matters to what experience you gain. What experience you gain contributes to your long term career goal.

### Your Current Role
Look at whether your work is good for your long term goal

#### Five Metrics to Keep An Eye on
Reflect on these metrics once every few months. Your job could destroy your career and market value.
- are you learning
- are you learning transferable skills
- how do you feel about recruiting your friends to this company
- how confident you feel
- how stressed you feel

#### Should you Change Role
You won't find a perfect role to match all of your goals. You need to do the trade-off.
- does your org shield you from outside world shift? do you learn the transferrable skills and keep up with the industry changes?


### Paths from Here

- Find a way to work effectively with less hours.
