## 2. Three Maps
You need context about the people you work with and understand the situation and how to make decisions.
You need to know the surroundings.
### 2.1 Uh, Did Anyone Bring a Map?
Draw some maps to better understand the big picture of where you are, how your organization work, what your team is trying to achieve.
- locator map: provide perspective to help you understand where you stand and what's your purpose in the wider organization and company
- topographical map: the hazards ahead, the politics, the organization chart and how org make decisions, the existing navigable paths
- treasure map: the goals and milestones on the journey.

You need deliberate practice to clarify those three maps everyday. The maps are obscured.

You need to sort throught the facts around you and extract the important facts that will affect your project and organization: meetings, emails, documents, wikis, tech talks
### 2.2 The Locator Map: Getting Perspective
To make good decisions, you need to be self-awared of you current stand and other point of views in bigger context.

There are some caveat you need to watch out.
- Don't just focus on local maximum.
- Don't take things outside of your current project as trivial.
- Don't be that frog being boilded down slowly.
- Don't forget what the work is for. The XYZ problem.

#### 2.2.1 Seeing Bigger
Look at where your org sit in the company. Check out the connection to external orgs inside the company, and how different teams in your org coordinate internally.
- Take an oursider's view: Do the technical decisions make sense outside your team? Does each decision make sense to your goal?
- Understand different people's point of view, especially those outside of yoru current most related group.(engineers in other org, product managers, customers, managers)
- Understand what's important for your company. Some goals are more significant than others, and that priority may change over time.
- Understand your customer and what success mean to them.
- Respect what comes before. Your problem is not likely a new one. Understand what other people have done before drafting a new one.
### 2.3 The Topographical Map: Navigatinv the Terrain
#### 2.3.1 Rough Terrain
Why do you need a topographical map?
- You know how to build the momentum for a project. Good idea needs traction. Who could be the sponsor? How to help the idea spread? How to make it to the finish line?
- You know the hardest part in advance. You know how to navigate an obstacle and when to take an alternative path.
- You know your organization's planning cycle and how not to wait due to the policy/mechanism.
#### 2.3.2 Understanding Your Organization
What is the average journey for your organization to navigate a project?

- The culture: individual autonomy, feeling included, mistake tolerance, who make the decision, project friction, personality
- information transparency: do you have access to information that will affect your work?
- Oral information or written information. Do your org do the deliberate planning on your tasks or is it casual?
- Top-down or bottom up initiative: do you get support for initiative that you think it's important?
- Move fast or slow. Do you need to go round-by-round to ensure the plan has coverred all corner cases?
- Front door or back channel: do you file ticket to communicate with others or just have an informal chat?
- allocated or available task planning
- how to you gain trust and get promoted?
- What do your leaders think is important? power-oriented, rule-oriented, performance-oriented?
- Understand the gaps between different team/org: responsibilities, culture, goal, planning
- Understand how your bar-raiser/gatekeepers make the decision.
- How to resolve conflicts and reach consensus cross-team.
- Is it an unwinnable fight?
- Use well-defined paths if exist, and also learn the unofficial paths.

#### 2.3.3 What Points of Interest Are On Your Map?
Something you could consider to put on your map: unexpected cliffs, rude behaviors or communication styles, guardrails, local politcs: who's at war with whom, leader styles
- How do information flow in your org and how does decisions happen? Is there a memo?
- Where is the room where decisions take place or are decisions made informally in 1-1 conversations
- Ask to join in the room. Show your impact and add values: show up prepared, speak concisely, be a collaborative contributor.
- Discover the unwritten structures that influence your org.

#### 2.3.4 Keeping Your Topographic Map Up To Date
You might need to keep track of team leaders, dependent project delivery, quarterly planning cycle, launch of new useful tool/platform, time leave for stake holders.
- Keep up with announcement channels/email lists
- Stay attached to the work you are doing: take a task and make code changes, code reviews, do local testing
- Read senior people's calendar, meeting notes, communication channels
- Make time to read design docs, proposals, press release.
- Talk to your leadership.
- Chat with collegues.

#### 2.3.5 If the Terrain Is Still Difficult to Navigate, Be a Bridge
What could slow down the org: teams don't know how to talk to each other, nobody takes ownership to make decisions.
- You could bridge the gap by: writing documents to show how projects connect to each other, sending email summary, shedule meetings with people on important topics

### 2.4 The Treasure Map: Remind Me Where We're Going?
Know what your goal is and why it's important.

#### 2.4.1 Chasing Shiny Things
Why are you chasing after those short-term deliveries? How do they connect the dots and add value to your long-term goal?
- Keep everyone in the same direction.
- The existing project should add value to solving long term problems.
- Get aligned on the initiatives and don't compete in chaos.
- Grow people to see, plan and achieve big projects.

#### 2.4.2 Taking a Longer View
- Work backwards from a long term goal. Find out the options you have to get closer to it.
- Share the map with others and help them understand why it matters.

#### 2.4.3 If the Treasure Map Is Still Unclear, It Might Be Time to Draw a New One
You could write up summary for misalignment, spell out facts and share them. But you might still find multiple competing paths ahead.

### 2.5 Your Personal Journey
As you grow more senior, the impact of your work takes longer time to see.
- Tell the story. What your goals are and how you plan to achieve. 
- Make the small tasks become part of the big story. How does current work contribute to that goal.

## 4. Finite Time
When you level up, you see more problems at hand. And you can't do them all.
### 4.1 Doing All the Things
You decide what you work on everyday with limited time: what's important for the company, team and you.

### 4.2 Time
Every task you choose to work on has an opportunity cost. Decision comes with a cost.
#### 4.2.1 Finite Time
- Put focused work time in the calendar and plan for task you would like to take on for the day and week. Thus you keep track of what you plan to do throughout the day and if you have time for a side request.
- If you look at longer terms, you might need to block some fraction of time
#### 4.2.2 How Busy Do You Like to Be
- Some work could be unpredictable.
- Drop something for emergency.
- Observe your weekly work load and comfort/stress limit.
#### 4.2.3 ProjectQueue.pop()
- Locator map tells you what's important. Treasure map tells you what you could deliver.
- Evaluate the importance of each project, task, issue.
- List out a list of work you should take. Sort them out according to priority.
### 4.3 Resource Constraints
### 4.4 Choosing Projects

## 7. You're a Role Model Now(Sorry)
### What Does It Mean to Do a Good Job?

If you are a role model, then
- you should point out the problems
- you should influence through good, thoughtful decisions and effective collaboration
- others would see how you behave and take that as a standard, and emulate what you do in order to level up
- you should take leadership as some skill to learn similiar to a new programming language/tech stack. You could start small, eg. by help onboard new team members

### Be Competent
Staff engineer = technical + leader

#### Know Things
Devote enough time to building experience
- time * (learning + practice) => tech skill
- You are not expected to know every topic. It's okay if you know the least on some new area/domain. Start learning from there.

Learning quickly
1. Walk through an example, some basic concepts
2. Know the trade-off, constraints, assumptions
3. What technologies are on the market, how to use them
4. What is famous in the domain(people, literature, company), what they advocate for
5. take on some projects

Stay engaged with the new changes happenning in your industry.

Stay anchored in technology as well as know how your company operate.

Learn in public: deliberately show other engineers what you are learning and how you learn.


#### Be Self-Aware
Self-awareness: 
- what you can do, what you can't do
- how much time it will take
- What you know, what you don't know. Admit what you know and step up to help what needed. Admit what you don't know and ask others to explain like I am 5yr.

You have your own perspective and context and understanding of the world. But that might not seem obvious to others. You need to escape the echo chamber and bridge the gap for others in order to understand what you see.

Try to explain things in plain text and as if you are explaining to a 5 years old child.


#### Have High Standards
Your standards will influence how other people work.

You should know the high standard and aim for that whenever you are working on something, even if they might not be the parts you enjoy.
- Write clear doc
- Know when and why your software breaks
- Put aside your ego and ask someone else to make your work better: code review, design review, peer evaluations and feedbacks
- Ack you will make mistakes. Don't defend them. Try to learn from them and set out to root-cause it and make a fix. 

Show your work and earn trust from others.


### Be Responsible

#### Take Ownership
You own the whole problem: you are accountable for navigating the problem, driving end to end development, unblocking any issues occuring.
- You have good judgement.
- You share the context of what you are doing with others, thus you give other opportunities to intervene if you are doing something dangerous.
- You make decisions when needed even if you could be wrong. Don't just stay on the fense: weigh the options, choose decisively and explain your reasoning
- Ask dump questions. You should make the implicit explicit.
- Glue work: unblocking, onboarding, reminders, mentoring, scheduling. This is needed for project success.

#### Take Charge
When you see a gap, you step in to fill that gap.
- You should be able to take control of SEV 2 chaos. You should have the emergency plan before disaster occurs. Take notes and make sure everyone envolved has the context.
- Ask for more information when everyone is confused, even if you think you are the only one feeling confused.
- Don't feign surprise. Encourage others to ask basic questions.
- Drive the meeting. Step up and collect items to discuss in the meeting. Remember your expectation for the meeting and drag it back to the topic when meeting goes too far away.
- Make the meeting notes. Write down important facts you learn, key decisions made.
- Stay calm. Think about the impact of your actions. Don't let you worries spill out on many people.
- Don't blame. Create an environment where everyone feels safe to talk about the event when something breaks.
- Be consistent. Work in a way that is substainable for you.

### Remember the Goal
Think about the broader context: the business goal your org is trying to achieve, what your customers care about, your team's success.

#### Remember There's a Business
THe software is the means to those ends, not an end in itself.
- When you priority is timeline, deliver faster solution is better. If there's a hard deadline, imperfect solution is better than a late one.
- Your priorities will change.
- There's a budget for your project. Be aware how your company make money and the economic environment. Decide what to suggest for your org based on that.
- Staffing a project has an opportunity cost. Choose work that your business need the most.

#### Remember There's a User
- Write down the requirements. Be clear.

#### Remember There's a Team
- Be a force multiplier. Empower your collegues to do better work.
- Don't be a single point of failure.

### Look Ahead
Software engineering is programing integrated over time. Think beyond the current moment and don't optimize for now at the cost of future velocity or engineering ability.

#### Anticipate What You'll Wish You'd Done
What will future you wish present you had done?
- Telegraph what's coming. Anounce the intension to deprecate old systems early so that other team could make plans in advance.
- Make your codebase, production enviroment, documentation ready to use and move around for whoever comes along next.
- Make your environment a better place. Find tools/approaches to increase your velocity and reliability. Automate repetative process.
- Write down formative systems and practices. Create instituition memory.

#### Expect Failures
Plan for what you'll do when something goes wrong. Test the error paths and design your system to be fault tolerant.

#### Optimize for Maintenance, Not Creation
Design your software with good maintenance. You spend more time maintaining your code than creating it. Even if your code remain unchanged, the ecosystem will change over time.

- Make your system easy to understand. Write readable code. Write good documents.
- Keep it super simple. Devote time to simplify the current solution or come up with alternatives.
- Build your system in a way that's easy to decommission.(modular)

#### Create Future Leaders
Be the engineer that everyone wants to work with.

### Summary
Competence <- experience + knowledge =  time * doing + time * (learning expertise)

Be self-aware: Unknown Unknown

Take charge on hard problems and acknowledge the discomfort.

Write things down clearly.

Design your software that's easy to maintain, easy to decommission and fault-tolerant.

The metric for success is whether other people want to work with you.

## 9. What's Next
You now know 
- What your job is
- your scope and primary focus
- how to develop strategy and vision
- how to prioritize work and lead projects
- how to navigate obstacles
- how to model good engineering
- how to level up your team

Think about how to level up your life?

### Your Career
Where are you going in your career and life journey? Look around and think of the options as paths in the trail map.

#### What's Important to You
- Some life priorities could: being financially secure, supporting family, having flexible schedules, learning opportunities, challenging yourself
- Find out what matters to you and work backwards from that

#### Where Are You Going?
- Look at the big picture and your priorities
- Figure out a plan, set up some milestones
- Make SMART goals(specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, timebounded)
- Checkout others' journey. Don't limit yourself to your current perspective. 
- Consider path that are risker. Don't limit yourself to stay in the comfort zone.

#### What Do You Need to Invest in?
What skill do those future role models have? How do they spend time? How do they build up the network?
- Skills are learnable. You need to make efforts to get experience points for skills you would like to level up.
- Work backwards from your goal and find out the necessary skills. You can't be expert at everything.(technical domain, glue work, leadership)
- Learn how to build a network for your career. 
- Making a name for yourself and make your career profolio visible.
- Decide which project to work on. Your decision on role matters to what experience you gain. What experience you gain contributes to your long term career goal.

### Your Current Role
Look at whether your work is good for your long term goal

#### Five Metrics to Keep An Eye on
Reflect on these metrics once every few months. Your job could destroy your career and market value.
- are you learning
- are you learning transferable skills
- how do you feel about recruiting your friends to this company
- how confident you feel
- how stressed you feel

#### Should you Change Role
You won't find a perfect role to match all of your goals. You need to do the trade-off.
- does your org shield you from outside world shift? do you learn the transferrable skills and keep up with the industry changes?


### Paths from Here

- Find a way to work effectively with less hours.

### Your Choices Matter
