## You're a Role Model Now(Sorry)
### What Does It Mean to Do a Good Job?

If you are a role model, then
- you should point out the problems
- you should influence through good, thoughtful decisions and effective collaboration
- others would see how you behave and take that as a standard, and emulate what you do in order to level up
- you should take leadership as some skill to learn similiar to a new programming language/tech stack. You could start small, eg. by help onboard new team members

### Be Competent

Staff engineer = technical + leader

#### Know Things

Devote enough time to building experience
- time * (learning + practice) => tech skill
- You are not expected to know every topic. It's okay if you know the least on some new area/domain. Start learning from there.

Learning quickly
1. Walk through an example, some basic concepts
2. Know the trade-off, constraints, assumptions
3. What technologies are on the market, how to use them
4. What is famous in the domain(people, literature, company), what they advocate for
5. take on some projects

Stay engaged with the new changes happenning in your industry.

Stay anchored in technology as well as know how your company operate.

Learn in public: deliberately show other engineers what you are learning and how you learn.


#### Be Self-Aware
Self-awareness: 
- what you can do, what you can't do
- how much time it will take
- What you know, what you don't know. Admit what you know and step up to help what needed. Admit what you don't know and ask others to explain like I am 5yr.

You have your own perspective and context and understanding of the world. But that might not seem obvious to others. You need to escape the echo chamber and bridge the gap for others in order to understand what you see.

Try to explain things in plain text and as if you are explaining to a 5 years old child.


#### Have High Standards
Your standards will influence how other people work.

You should know the high standard and aim for that whenever you are working on something, even if they might not be the parts you enjoy.
- Write clear doc
- Know when and why your software breaks
- Put aside your ego and ask someone else to make your work better: code review, design review, peer evaluations and feedbacks
- Ack you will make mistakes. Don't defend them. Try to learn from them and set out to root-cause it and make a fix. 

Show your work and earn trust from others.


### Be Responsible

#### Take Ownership
You own the whole problem: you are accountable for navigating the problem, driving end to end development, unblocking any issues occuring.
- You have good judgement.
- You share the context of what you are doing with others, thus you give other opportunities to intervene if you are doing something dangerous.
- You make decisions when needed even if you could be wrong. Don't just stay on the fense: weigh the options, choose decisively and explain your reasoning
- Ask dump questions. You should make the implicit explicit.
- Glue work: unblocking, onboarding, reminders, mentoring, scheduling. This is needed for project success.

#### Take Charge
When you see a gap, you step in to fill that gap.
- You should be able to take control of SEV 2 chaos. You should have the emergency plan before disaster occurs. Take notes and make sure everyone envolved has the context.
- Ask for more information when everyone is confused, even if you think you are the only one feeling confused.
- Don't feign surprise. Encourage others to ask basic questions.
- Drive the meeting. Step up and collect items to discuss in the meeting. Remember your expectation for the meeting and drag it back to the topic when meeting goes too far away.
- Make the meeting notes. Write down important facts you learn, key decisions made.
- Stay calm. Think about the impact of your actions. Don't let you worries spill out on many people.
- Don't blame. Create an environment where everyone feels safe to talk about the event when something breaks.
- Be consistent. Work in a way that is substainable for you.

### Remember the Goal
Think about the broader context: the business goal your org is trying to achieve, what your customers care about, your team's success.

#### Remember There's a Business
THe software is the means to those ends, not an end in itself.
- When you priority is timeline, deliver faster solution is better. If there's a hard deadline, imperfect solution is better than a late one.
- Your priorities will change.
- There's a budget for your project. Be aware how your company make money and the economic environment. Decide what to suggest for your org based on that.
- Staffing a project has an opportunity cost. Choose work that your business need the most.

#### Remember There's a User
- Write down the requirements. Be clear.

#### Remember There's a Team
- Be a force multiplier. Empower your collegues to do better work.
- Don't be a single point of failure.

### Look Ahead
Software engineering is programing integrated over time. Think beyond the current moment and don't optimize for now at the cost of future velocity or engineering ability.

#### Anticipate What You'll Wish You'd Done
What will future you wish present you had done?
- Telegraph what's coming. Anounce the intension to deprecate old systems early so that other team could make plans in advance.
- Make your codebase, production enviroment, documentation ready to use and move around for whoever comes along next.
- Make your environment a better place. Find tools/approaches to increase your velocity and reliability. Automate repetative process.
- Write down formative systems and practices. Create instituition memory.

#### Expect Failures
Plan for what you'll do when something goes wrong. Test the error paths and design your system to be fault tolerant.

#### Optimize for Maintenance, Not Creation
Design your software with good maintenance. You spend more time maintaining your code than creating it. Even if your code remain unchanged, the ecosystem will change over time.

- Make your system easy to understand. Write readable code. Write good documents.
- Keep it super simple. Devote time to simplify the current solution or come up with alternatives.
- Build your system in a way that's easy to decommission.(modular)

#### Create Future Leaders
Be the engineer that everyone wants to work with.

### Summary
Competence <- experience + knowledge =  time * doing + time * (learning expertise)

Be self-aware: Unknown Unknown

Take charge on hard problems and acknowledge the discomfort.

Write things down clearly.

Design your software that's easy to maintain, easy to decommission and fault-tolerant.

The metric for success is whether other people want to work with you.
